View:
- This is only the UI created by html and css

ViewModel:
- Is a Javascript Object with properties and functions to represent data
- Connected with the View by data-bind concepts used in html.
- kKnockoutJS automates data refresh through use of Observable
- Direct connection between display and underlying data
- Create your own bindings for specific behavior

Model:
- Connected with the ViewModel
- domain data on server, manipulated by request from ViewModel
- Data stored in persistent storage (Database, cookies etc..)

Outside scope:
- Most of the time data is saved and loaded via an Ajax call
